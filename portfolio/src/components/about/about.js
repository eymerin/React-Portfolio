            <span className='aboutDescription'>I love spending time outdoors whether it's camping, backpacking, mountain biking, or photographing landscapes. I am eager to travel more in search of new places and subjects to shoot. I also really enjoy gaming, film, music, and all things fantasy/sci-fi. When I am not working you can find me spending time with my dogs, my friends, or my family. I strive to be authentic and open minded in all things, and hope to encourage others to do the same.
